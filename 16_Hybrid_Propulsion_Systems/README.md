### <ins>Title: Sustainable Energy Solutions for Marine Vessels - Hybrid Propulsion Systems</ins>
## Background:  
Marine vessels are major contributors to global carbon emissions, with traditional diesel engines being a significant source of pollution. Hybrid propulsion systems, which combine conventional engines with alternative energy sources such as batteries or renewable energy, offer a solution to reduce the environmental impact of marine transport.  
## Importance:  
Implementing hybrid propulsion systems can lower fuel consumption, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and contribute to cleaner, more energy-efficient marine operations. This aligns with international goals for sustainable shipping and reducing maritime carbon footprints.  
## Challenges:  
- Developing efficient and scalable hybrid propulsion systems that can handle the energy demands of large marine vessels  
- Ensuring the reliability and safety of these systems in harsh marine environments  
- Addressing the high initial investment costs for retrofitting existing vessels or building new hybrid ships
