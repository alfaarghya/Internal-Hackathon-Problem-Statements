### <ins>Title: IoT-Enabled Ballast Water Management for Pollution Control</ins>

## Background:  
Ballast water discharge is a significant environmental challenge in marine transportation, as it can introduce invasive species into new ecosystems. IoT-enabled systems allow for real-time monitoring and control of ballast water treatment, reducing environmental damage and preserving marine biodiversity.

## Importance:  
By using IoT for ballast water management, shipping companies can better comply with environmental regulations, minimize pollution, and prevent the spread of invasive aquatic species, contributing to the health of global marine ecosystems.

## Challenges:  
- Ensuring IoT systems are reliable in the harsh marine environment  
- Developing IoT solutions that are compatible with diverse ballast water treatment technologies  
- Managing large volumes of sensor data effectively to provide real-time insights
