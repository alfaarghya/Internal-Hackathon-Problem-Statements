### <ins>Title: IoT-Based Energy Monitoring for Marine Vessels</ins>

## Background:  
Energy efficiency is a critical concern for marine vessels, which are energy-intensive. Real-time IoT-based energy monitoring systems can optimize fuel use and reduce energy waste, promoting both economic and environmental sustainability.

## Importance:  
IoT-enabled energy monitoring systems provide real-time insights that help ship operators make informed decisions, enhance operational efficiency, and ensure compliance with international emissions standards.

## Challenges:  
- Implementing IoT systems in environments with limited connectivity at sea  
- Securing the data transmission process across large oceanic distances  
- Developing user-friendly interfaces that provide actionable, real-time energy data to ship operators
