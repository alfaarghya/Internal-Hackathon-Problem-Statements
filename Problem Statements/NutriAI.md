## 4. NutriAI

### Background
Accurately tracking nutritional intake is vital for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, but the manual process of logging meals and estimating portion sizes is often time-consuming and prone to errors. People frequently misjudge portion sizes or forget to log their meals, leading to inconsistent tracking. This lack of accurate nutritional data can make it difficult for users to meet their dietary goals, whether for weight management, disease prevention, or general wellness.

### Importance
An automated system for tracking nutrition could significantly improve the accuracy and ease of dietary monitoring. It can help users make informed decisions about their food choices by providing real-time estimates of nutritional content. This is especially important for individuals managing diet-related conditions such as obesity, diabetes, or cardiovascular diseases. With accurate feedback, users can better adhere to their dietary goals, leading to improved health outcomes.

### Problem Statement
**Input:** The user uploads or takes a photo of their meal.  
**Output:** The system provides:
1. **Nutritional estimates**: Calories, macronutrients (proteins, fats, carbohydrates), and key micronutrients (vitamins, minerals) based on the food items in the image.
2. **Personalized feedback**: Meal logging, progress tracking, and personalized recommendations aligned with the userâ€™s dietary goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, balanced nutrition).

The application should allow users to:
1. Automatically log their meals by simply taking a picture.
2. Track their nutritional intake over time, including daily, weekly, or monthly summaries.
3. Set dietary goals and receive personalized meal recommendations based on their objectives.

The model should:
- Identify multiple food items within a single image.
- Estimate nutritional content quickly and accurately across a wide range of food types and cuisines.

### Challenge
The model must handle diverse food presentations and cuisines, making accurate portion size estimates from varied perspectives and image qualities. The web/mobile application should have a user-friendly interface that processes images in real-time and allows for seamless meal tracking, even on the go.
