## 3. GestureFlow

### Background
Traditional input devices like keyboards and mice are not always practical or accessible, particularly for individuals with mobility impairments or in environments where hands-free interaction is required. While voice control offers an alternative, it is limited in noisy environments or situations where vocal commands are inconvenient. Gesture-based interaction provides a promising solution by allowing users to control devices through natural hand movements, making it especially valuable in sectors like healthcare, industry, and accessibility.

### Importance
Gesture recognition technology can greatly enhance accessibility, enabling users with disabilities to interact with computers without traditional input devices. It is also valuable in sterile environments, such as operating rooms, or industrial settings where hands are occupied. By providing a hands-free, intuitive way to control devices, gesture-based systems can improve efficiency and enable new forms of human-computer interaction.

### Problem Statement
**Input:** The user interacts with a webcam or external camera, performing hand gestures.  
**Output:** The system recognizes predefined hand gestures and translates them into computer actions, such as:
1. **Click**
2. **Scroll**
3. **Navigate**
4. **... etc**

The application should allow users to:
1. Customize gesture-to-action mappings.
2. Train the system to recognize new, user-defined gestures.
3. Adjust gesture recognition sensitivity and define activation zones on the screen for more accurate control.

The model should:
- Recognize at least 5 predefined gestures with optimum accuracy.
- Adapt to different lighting conditions and various hand positions.
- Perform with low latency to ensure smooth, real-time interaction.

### Challenge
The gesture recognition model must be robust against environmental changes, such as varying lighting or backgrounds, and accurately distinguish between different hand movements. The desktop application should be responsive and provide a simple interface for gesture customization, allowing users to personalize the system based on their needs and preferences.
