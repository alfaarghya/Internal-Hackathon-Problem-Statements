## 9. DevsType (Typing Test Application)

### Background

In the present fast moving digital world, typing speed and accuracy are the most important skills that one needs to develop for jobs and even for daily activities. A website which allows its visitors to practice, test, and improve their typing skills while also competing with others is educative as well as entertaining. Inclusions of real-time progress tracking and competitive features like leaderboards and group challenges help make learning interesting and fun.

### Importance

The development of an integrated typing test platform will not only help the users improve their typing but also enable them to participate in friendly competitions.In addition, setting up environments where users can compete with friends encourages community building and develops healthy competition.

### Problem Statement

Users often seek ways to improve their typing skills and engage in friendly competition with others. Current solutions may lack features that allow for both individual skill tracking and competitive interactions. There is a need for a web application where users can test their typing speed and accuracy, track their progress on a leaderboard. The leaderboard should update at intervals set by users to minimize database strain, and competitions in rooms should provide real-time progress tracking.

### Challenges

1. **Type Test:** Design a feature-rich test that measures both the speed and accuracy of typing, with an intuitive interface. Real-time feedback should be provided to visually distinguish between correct and incorrect letters/words through color-coding during the test.
2. **Leaderboard Management** Implementing a leaderboard that tracks and displays users' performance, while reducing database load by updating periodically.
3. **User Authentication:** Ensuring that users can create accounts and log in to access leaderboards, dashboard and competition features, with secure data storage and access control.
