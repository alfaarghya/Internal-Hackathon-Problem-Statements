        Recipe Drive (Recipe Sharing Community)
      </h1>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Background</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Cooking enthusiasts often seek ways to organize their favorite recipes
        and share culinary creations with others. Combining personal recipe
        management with community sharing can enhance the experience for users
        who want both to keep track of their recipes and engage with a broader
        community of food lovers.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Importance</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        An integrated platform allows users to store, organize, and share
        recipes efficiently. By providing features for adding ingredients,
        cooking instructions, and categorizing recipes, users can easily manage
        their personal recipe collections. Additionally, sharing recipes with
        others, commenting on, and rating recipes fosters a vibrant community
        where users can discover new dishes and interact with fellow cooking
        enthusiasts.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Problem Statement</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Users often face challenges in managing their personal recipe
        collections and engaging with others in the cooking community. Existing
        solutions might lack features for effective recipe organization,
        searching, and sharing. There is a need for a comprehensive platform
        that allows users to store and categorize their recipes, share them with
        others, and engage with the community through comments and ratings.
