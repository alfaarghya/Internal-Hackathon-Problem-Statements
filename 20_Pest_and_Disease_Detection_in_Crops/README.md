### <ins>Title: IoT-Enabled Pest and Disease Detection in Crops</ins>

## Background:  
Pests and crop diseases can cause devastating losses for farmers, often spreading before they are detected. IoT-based systems can monitor crops in real-time, using sensors and AI to identify early signs of infestation or disease, enabling timely interventions.

## Importance:  
Early detection reduces the need for chemical pesticides, minimizes crop losses, and leads to healthier produce. This contributes to more sustainable agricultural practices while improving farmers' profitability and food security.

## Challenges:  
- Creating accurate systems that detect a wide range of pests and diseases  
- Integrating AI-driven analysis for real-time disease and pest prediction  
- Ensuring the affordability and ease of use for farmers with limited technical knowledge
